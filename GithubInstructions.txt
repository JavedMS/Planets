terminals opening
default branch upon creating new repo will be called master branch. it is recommended to name it as main
git checkout -b main	(to change branches)
git show HEAD~3 filename (to see what changes made in previous 3rd commit from now)
1)git checkout HEAD~3 filename (to see what changes are added during comit 3. Also discard changes that are made yet not staged.)
2) git reset HEAD filename (to unstage the changes made using git add)
3) git revert [commit ID] (to revert to the mentioned ID's commit)
cat filename (to see the data/text/code contained in the file)
git log --patch filename (to see in a specific file for what each commit is changing)
advanced: git log --patch HEAD~5 *.txt (show all changes in text files only from the 5th position of head)
.gitignore rules: https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-use-gitignore/; https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/06-ignore.html
1) touch .getignore (creating); nano .getignore (adding); cat .getignore (to see);
git remote add origin SSH (to link a remote repository with local)

git pull --allow-unrelated-histories origin BranchName (to pull the branch if branch has unrelated histories considering remote and local versions)

git remote add URL (to connect new remote repo with local repo). git remote (use to check how many repo are connected)

git clone (to clone a new/whole remote repo. better to use this option as it may auto merge future pulls/push)
git pull <repo name> <branch name>; git push <repo name> <branch name>

git branch -d [D to force] "branch name" (to delete a branch locally)
git push <remote name> -d <branch name> (to delete a remote branch)
git clean -f <filename> (to remove untracked files permanently from local repo)

git stash (to save changes of active branch, if checkout to other branch needed. later changes could be recovered)

CONDA: packageNotFoundError: can be solved using: conda config --set restore_free_channel true
